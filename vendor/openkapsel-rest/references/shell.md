# Shell tasks, streaming I/O, and process inspection

Read `GET /discovery/shell` before use. It states whether Shell is `none`, `restricted`, or `full`, the active sandbox backend, network access, task limits, timeout limits, and cgroup availability.

Restricted Shell and full Shell have different boundaries. Restricted Shell is confined by its configured backend, mounts, network setting, and available cgroup limits. Full Shell runs as the OpenKapsel service user and is not constrained by token path grants or the network flag.

## Persistent Shell environment

The control-authenticated `/env` endpoint stores Shell configuration for the stable app identity behind the current token record. It is distinct from the local `.openkapsel.env` file used by this Skill to find a server and credentials. Two token records may share one Workspace while retaining different Shell environments; rotating either record's read/control credentials preserves its configuration.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/env` | Return the complete variables and POSIX rc content; treat the response as secret and do not log it |
| `PUT` | `/env` | Completely replace variables and rc; include `plan_id`, `taskname`, and `message` |
| `DELETE` | `/env` | Clear the configuration; include mutation Context |

Example replacement:

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "API_KEY": "secret",
    "BUILD_MODE": "release"
  },
  "rc": "umask 077\nalias ll='ls -la'",
  "plan_id": 42,
  "taskname": "shell-config",
  "message": "Configure build environment"
}
```

Variables and rc are injected into later full, Bubblewrap, and Podman Shell tasks. The rc contract is POSIX `/bin/sh`, not Bash-only syntax. OpenKapsel-owned launcher, path, proxy, loader, and `OPENKAPSEL_*` names are reserved; inspect Discovery for the exact list and size limits. Service-process environment variables are not inherited wholesale, and configured values are not placed in sandbox launcher arguments. The rc is executable Shell code with the same authority as that token's Shell mode, so do not treat it as a safer permission boundary.

## Start and inspect tasks

`POST /shell/exec` returns `202` with `task_id`:

```json
{
  "command": "python3 -m unittest",
  "cwd": ".",
  "timeout_seconds": 3600,
  "interactive": false,
  "plan_id": 42,
  "taskname": "tests",
  "message": "Run the test suite"
}
```

The command runs asynchronously. `timeout_seconds` may be `null` or within the published bounds. `interactive: true` keeps stdin available.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/tasks?offset=0&limit=100&status=running` | List this token's running/finished tasks; omit `status` for all |
| `GET` | `/tasks/<task_id>` | Current state and exit metadata |
| `GET` | `/tasks/<task_id>/output` | Incremental stdout/stderr by byte cursor |
| `GET` | `/tasks/<task_id>/stream` | Bounded SSE output until `done` or `reconnect` |
| `POST` | `/tasks/<task_id>/stdin` | Send UTF-8/Base64 input or close stdin |
| `POST` | `/tasks/<task_id>/interrupt` | SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after grace period |
| `POST` | `/tasks/<task_id>/kill` | Immediate SIGKILL of the process group |
| `GET` | `/sandbox/processes` | Token cgroup process/resource view for restricted Shell |

## Output polling

Call:

```text
GET /tasks/<id>/output?stdout_offset=0&stderr_offset=0&limit=65536&wait_seconds=20
```

Advance each cursor to its returned `next_offset`. A `gap` means older bytes fell outside the bounded stream and the response tells where retained output begins. `wait_seconds` supports long polling up to the published maximum.

SSE uses `text/event-stream` with `output`, `done`, and `reconnect` events:

```text
GET /tasks/<id>/stream?stdout_offset=<n>&stderr_offset=<n>
```

`reconnect` means the maximum stream duration was reached while the task is still running. Reconnect using its exact `stdout_offset` and `stderr_offset`. Concurrent streams are limited globally and per token; `429 too_many_streams` includes `Retry-After` and the published limits.

The generic helper writes SSE directly rather than buffering it:

```bash
python3 scripts/openkapsel_http.py GET tasks/<id>/stream --stream
```

## Interactive input and termination

`POST /tasks/<id>/stdin` JSON accepts exactly one of `data` (UTF-8) or `data_base64`, plus optional `close`. Include JSON Context fields. The task must have been created with `interactive: true`.

Interrupt and kill have no JSON body, so send all three `OpenKapsel-*` Context headers. Prefer interrupt; use force-kill when graceful termination is inappropriate or failed.

`GET /sandbox/processes?offset=0&limit=100` is available only for restricted Shell when server cgroup support is enabled. It reports aggregate memory/CPU/PID/OOM counters and process rows. A task limit, PID limit, memory limit, or CPU limit is independent; consult Discovery rather than assuming defaults.
